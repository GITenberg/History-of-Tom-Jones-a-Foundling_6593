description: '"A foundling of mysterious parentage brought up by Mr. Allworthy on
  his country estate, Tom Jones is deeply in love with the seemingly unattainable
  Sophia Western, the beautiful daughter of the neighboring squire--though he sometimes
  succumbs to the charms of the local girls. When Tom is banished to make his own
  fortune and Sophia follows him to London to escape an arranged marriage, the adventure
  begins. A vivid Hogarthian panorama of eighteenth-century life, spiced with danger
  and intrigue, bawdy exuberance and good-natured authorial interjections, Tom Jones
  is one of the greatest and most ambitious comic novels in English literature."--Amazon.com.'
